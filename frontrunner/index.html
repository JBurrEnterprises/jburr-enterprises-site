    <h1>FrontRunner Signals — Premium TradingView Script</h1>
    <p>
      FrontRunner Signals is a premium, invite-only TradingView indicator built for traders who want
      structured, repeatable entries instead of chasing hype.

      <h2>What FrontRunner Signals Does</h2>
      <p>
        FrontRunner helps you identify structured opportunities by combining impulse–balance–impulse
        concepts with zone awareness, so your entries are based on context instead of randomness.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Highlights key balance areas and impulse breaks in price action.</li>
        <li>Surfaces zones where price is likely to react, not just noise.</li>
        <li>Designed to work directly inside TradingView — no external tools required.</li>
        <li>Works across stocks, options, futures, crypto, and forex charts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Access Works</h2>
      <p>
        FrontRunner Signals is delivered as an invite-only script on TradingView:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You subscribe via a secure payment link (Stripe).</li>
        <li>You provide your TradingView username at checkout.</li>
        <li>Your username is added to the script’s invite-only access list.</li>
        <li>You use the script directly in TradingView with ongoing updates.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="subtle">
        Full automation of TradingView access is planned. For now, access is manually granted
        shortly after purchase.
