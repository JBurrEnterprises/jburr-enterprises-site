      <h2>What Stratify Does</h2>
      <p>
        Stratify is designed to help you build a consistent trading process by scanning charts,
        surfacing structured opportunities, and keeping your focus on your plan instead of noise.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Scan multiple tickers for predefined conditions and structures.</li>
        <li>Visual proximity to key zones and levels (support, resistance, IBI-style areas).</li>
        <li>Keep your process local — minimal reliance on external cloud dashboards.</li>
        <li>Designed to complement TradingView, not replace it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="subtle">
        Stratify is currently in active development. The public download and subscription tiers will
        go live once the app reaches the first stable release.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Stratify Is For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Retail traders who want more structure and less gambling.</li>
        <li>Options traders who rely on technical structure and zones.</li>
        <li>People who prefer local tools and control over their own data.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>
