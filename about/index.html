    <h1>About J Burr Enterprises LLC</h1>
    <p>
      J Burr Enterprises LLC is a small, focused studio building tools at the intersection of trading, AI, and everyday life.
      The work is opinionated, practical, and designed to help real people make better decisions — not just chase the latest hype.
    </p>
    <div class="page-hero-meta">
      Multi-product, founder-led, and built around one simple idea: give people leverage they actually understand.

      <h2>What we build</h2>
      <p>
        The portfolio spans trading technology, AI assistants, and kids’ content — but all of it shares the same DNA:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity over noise</strong> — surfacing what matters instead of drowning you in flashing signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Local-first when possible</strong> — especially for trading and sensitive work.</li>
        <li><strong>Realistic expectations</strong> — tools that assist you; not magic buttons that promise the world.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subtle">
        Long term, the goal is a portfolio that stands on its own merit and is attractive to the right acquirer — without ever
        losing sight of the users it serves.

      <h2>Where this is going</h2>
      <p>
        Each product under J Burr Enterprises is designed to be useful long before it’s “perfect,” with a bias toward shipping,
        iterating, and listening hard to the people actually using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re here for Stratify, FrontRunner Signals, Counselix, Lifenex, PostPilot, or Ace’s Place, the mission is
        the same: build tools that quietly move your life a little bit closer to how you want it to look.
